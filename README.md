# parking-system
.   Using ultrasonic sensor I developed a system which can detect obstacles in the rear side of a car and start to warn the driver if the distance between the car and the obstacle became less than 100 cm by displaying the distance on a 7-segment display and turning a buzzer ON and OFF when the distance reaches 50 cm with a delay reduces according to the distance.
